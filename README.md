# photosync
[Unfinished] full stack web app to syncronise photos from SmugMug to Google Photos

This was a project I began to teach myself more Clojure (specifically, Clojure + ClojureScript on Google App Engine with Om Next and Material Design for the UI).

It is unfinished and incomplete but online in case it is useful to anyone.
